The CFG has a single return statement at node "8", which executes return $stack2;. This means that the final return value of the method is determined by the value of $stack2 at this node.
From the CFG, we observe the following assignments to $stack2:
Node "2" assigns $stack2 = 0, which ensures that the method returns false (as required by the method constraints).
Node "3" assigns $stack2 = 1, which would lead to an incorrect return value (true), violating the given method constraints.
To enforce the constraint that the return value must always be false, we must eliminate any execution paths that allow $stack2 = 1 to be assigned and subsequently influence the return statement.
Examining the CFG, we see that node "3" is reached via two edges:
"6" -> "3"[label="cfg_false"];
"7" -> "3"[label="cfg_true"];
Removing these edges ensures that execution can never reach node "3", effectively preventing $stack2 = 1 from being assigned.
However, after removing these edges, node "3" remains as an isolated entry point—this is not allowed because the CFG must have only one entry node, which is explicitly stated to be "4" [label="cs := @parameter0: java.lang.CharSequence"];.
To fully eliminate any influence of node "3" while maintaining a valid CFG structure, we must also remove the following outgoing edges from node "3”:
"3" -> "5"[label="cfg_next”];
"5" -> "8"[label="cfg_goto"];
```
