```thinking
In the given CFG, there are two return statements: "11" [label="return 0”]; and "12" [label="return 1”];.
Node "11" represents a return value of 0 (false).
Node "12" represents a return value of 1 (true).
Since the Method_Constraints specify that the return value must be true, we must ensure that execution can never reach node "11", and it must always reach node "12".
From the CFG, we see that "7" -> "11"[label="cfg_true"]; leads directly to return 0.
Thus, if execution follows edge "7" -> "11", the method would incorrectly return false, violating the constraint.
To enforce the constraint (return value must be true), we must prevent execution from reaching node "11". The only way to do so is by removing "7" -> "11"[label="cfg_true”];.
This ensures that when execution reaches node "7", it must always take the "cfg_false" branch ("7" -> "3"), allowing it to continue iterating and potentially reaching return 1.
Thus, we must remove the following edges:
